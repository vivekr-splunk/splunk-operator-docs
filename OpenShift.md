# Red Hat OpenShift Configuration

The Splunk Operator will always start Splunk Enterprise containers using
a specific, unprivileged `splunk(41812)` user and group to allow write access
to Kubernetes PersistentVolumes. This follows best security practices,
which helps prevent any malicious actor from escalating access outside of the
container and compromising the host. For more information, please see the
Splunk Enterprise container's
[Documentation on Security](https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk/blob/develop/docs/SECURITY.md).

The Splunk Enterprise pods are attached to the `default` serviceaccount or the configured
[serviceaccount](CustomResources.md#common-spec-parameters-for-splunk-enterprise-resources) if
any. The Splunk Operator pod is attached to the Service Account `splunk-operator-controller-manager`
and runs as user `1001`.

Users of Red Hat OpenShift may find that the default Security Context
Constraint is too restrictive. You can fix this by granting the appropriate
Service Accounts the `nonroot` Security Context Constraint by running the
following commands within your namespace:

For the Splunk Operator pod:
```
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user nonroot -z splunk-operator-controller-manager
```

For the Splunk Enterprise CR pods(replace `default` with the configured [serviceaccount](CustomResources.md#common-spec-parameters-for-splunk-enterprise-resources) if any):
```
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user nonroot -z default
```
